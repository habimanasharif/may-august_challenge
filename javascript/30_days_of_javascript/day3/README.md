# Data Types
DataTypes are used to desxribe the characteristics of data
they are two type of dataTypes:
1. primitive dataTypes
2. non primitive dataTypes

Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

1. Numbers - Integers, floats
2. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
3. Booleans - true or false value
4. Null - empty value or no value
5. Undefined - a declared variable without a value
6. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor

Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:

1. Objects
2. Arrays
## Primitive data types
Primitive data types are immutable(non-moddifiable) data type. once a premitive data type is created it cannot be modified

## Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc.


Exercise: Level 1

1. Declare a variable named challenge and assign it to an initial value '30 Days Of JavaScript'.
2. Print the string on the browser console using console.log()
3. Print the length of the string on the browser console using console.log()
4. Change all the string characters to capital letters using toUpperCase() method
    Change all the string characters to lowercase letters using toLowerCase() method
    Cut (slice) out the first word of the string using substr() or substring() method
    Slice out the phrase Days Of JavaScript from 30 Days Of JavaScript.
    Check if the string contains a word Script using includes() method
    Split the string into an array using split() method
    Split the string 30 Days Of JavaScript at the space using split() method
    'Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Amazon' split the string at the comma and change it to an array.
    Change 30 Days Of JavaScript to 30 Days Of Python using replace() method.
    What is character at index 15 in '30 Days Of JavaScript' string? Use charAt() method.
    What is the character code of J in '30 Days Of JavaScript' string using charCodeAt()
    Use indexOf to determine the position of the first occurrence of a in 30 Days Of JavaScript
    Use lastIndexOf to determine the position of the last occurrence of a in 30 Days Of JavaScript.
    Use indexOf to find the position of the first occurrence of the word because in the following sentence:'You cannot end a sentence with because because because is a conjunction'
    Use lastIndexOf to find the position of the last occurrence of the word because in the following sentence:'You cannot end a sentence with because because because is a conjunction'
    Use search to find the position of the first occurrence of the word because in the following sentence:'You cannot end a sentence with because because because is a conjunction'
    Use trim() to remove any trailing whitespace at the beginning and the end of a string.E.g ' 30 Days Of JavaScript '.
    Use startsWith() method with the string 30 Days Of JavaScript and make the result true
    Use endsWith() method with the string 30 Days Of JavaScript and make the result true
    Use match() method to find all the aâ€™s in 30 Days Of JavaScript
    Use concat() and merge '30 Days of' and 'JavaScript' to a single string, '30 Days Of JavaScript'
    Use repeat() method to print 30 Days Of JavaScript 2 times
